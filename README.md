## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Visual Studio Code
- Google Chrome

### What I learned
I have recently been learning about CSS positioning, so it was great to be able to use those new skills in this project. Most of the other styling properties were known to me prior, so it was fairly straightforward to implement them into the project.

### Continued development

I plan on working through other Frontend Mentor challenges in the future.

### Useful resources

- Google.com for looking up certain CSS properties.
